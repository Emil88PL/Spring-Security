// package com.example.test;

// import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
// import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

// @SpringBootApplication
// public class TestApplication { // Test

// 	public static void main(String[] args) {
// 		SpringApplication.run(TestApplication.class, args);
// 	}

// }

// The short answer is:

// Maven is build tool (like Make is for C/C++, or Ant and Gradle are for Java). 
// It compiles your source code into binary, runs the tests etc.

// Spring Boot is a library, which helps you create an application faster. 
// It is basically a bunch of code written by others available for you to use it.

// Your application can use Spring Boot as a library, and you can build it via Maven, so you can run your application as well.
